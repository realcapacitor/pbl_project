![Test Image 4](/Relay_Module/relay/Images/relay.png)
### Give +5V to VCC pin and Ground to the GND pin.
## For IN4
####     LEFT and MIDDLE is NC
####     RIGHT and MIDDLE is NO
####     To activate the relay between RIGHT and MIDDLE we have to pass
####     LOW command to the IN4 input

## For IN3
####     LEFT and MIDDLE is NC
####     RIGHT and MIDDLE is NO
####     To activate the relay between RIGHT and MIDDLE we have to pass
####     LOW command to the IN3 input
  
## For IN2
####     LEFT and MIDDLE is NC
####     RIGHT and MIDDLE is NO
####     To activate the relay between RIGHT and MIDDLE we have to pass
####     LOW command to the IN2 input
  
## FOR IN1
####     BUT...its' exactly opposite in case of IN1
####     RIGHT and MIDDLE is NC
####     LEFT and MIDDLE is NO
####     to activate the relay between LEFT and MIDDLE we have to pass
####     LOW command to the IN1 input.

###      Which clearly means that this module is faulty piece.
###       But whatever it is We can work with it.
